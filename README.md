# wowhead_storm_scraper
This project came from my absolute lazyness that I did not want to open my webbrowser every 3 hours to look up which Elemental Storm is active... So yes, this script does look up what storm currently is active... the reapeating is realised with Windows Task Scheduler

# To-Do
* switch between regions, telegram API-token etc. via config file
* custom "you still need this storm"
> Maybe even some automation, but I'll have to look deeper into this
